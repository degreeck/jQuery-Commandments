        "You shall not instantiate more than one jQuery object containing the same set of nodes.",

        "You shall place scripts dependent on the readiness of the DOM at the bottom of the document.",
        "You shall favor CSS3 selectors over jQuery's psuedo-classes and special filters.",
        "You shall not use browser detection or browser inference.",
        "You shall use the correct spelling of jQuery and honour the capitalisation of its Q in any correspondence relating to it.",
        "You shall isolate any issues you have before posting to IRC or a forum, and especially before opening a ticket in the bug tracker.",
        "You shall, when requiring a reference to a DOM node created by yourself, gain that reference prior to DOM injection.",
        "You shall favor event delegation when the event in question propagates and when there are a substantial number of elements to be bound to.",
        "You shall not use jQuery when a faster and terser solution exists in the native DOM API."
